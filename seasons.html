		<h1>We love everything mother nature has to offer</h1>
		<p><img src="coverphoto.png" class="bgpic">Everyone has their favorite season, but when it comes to the Four Seasons Organization, we love all four of the beautiful seasons mother earth provides us. Some areas experience longer durations of a specific season and some places don't have all four seasons. If you get to experience all four, you learn to apperciate each season as they go through the rotation</p>

<h2>What do we do?</h2>
<p>We provide the people on the internet a reliable and credited information about the four seasons that mother nature provides us. We love to talk about all the different types of seaons and what to expect throughout each season. Our organization praises mother nature and its four beautiful seasons. We look forward to present each season to you!!! </p>
