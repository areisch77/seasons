		<h1>Summer Fun</h1>
		<p><img src="summer.jpegg.jpg" class="bgpic">Summer is always looked forward to by the younger age group because it symbolizes vactation and relaxation in the sun. Summer is the warmest of the four seasons. With some people, its a love/hate relationship depending on location because some places get smoking hot. </p>

<h2>Summer Expectations</h2>
<p>During the summer solstice, the days are longest and the nights are the shortest. The day lengths decrease while the seasons make their cycle. With this season comes danger of dry areas throughout certain states. With the heat comes fire season due to the dry populations.
